                This thesis was stated in his article "ON ACTIVATION OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN THE DEFENSE AND INDUSTRIAL SECTOR OF UKRAINE" by Professor of the National Institute for Strategic Studies Vitaliy Begma and Director of the Corporation. Oksana Vrublevska. The article was prepared in a collection of reports for the IX International Scientific and Practical Conference and published in June this year. Central Research Institute of Armaments and Military Equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The editorial board of the Defense Industrial Courier news agency publishes the most interesting reports.            </p>
      
            <p>Preservation of capacities and further development of the national defense industry requires the implementation of a number of organizational, technological, investment and other measures. This is not about creating a national defense industry in the near future, which will be able to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to provide all types and types of modern weapons. Today, the state's efforts should be focused on identifying key areas for the development of relevant local clusters and centers of competence for the creation of weapons for the Armed Forces and other legitimate military formations.
            </p>
     
            <p>The most important task for the domestic defense industry in the field of military-technical cooperation is the import of military goods, raw materials and materials to replace the Russian, wide involvement of Ukrainian defense companies in international research and production cooperation, transfer and mastery of modern weapons production technologies. , repair and maintenance of foreign weapons to be purchased, implementation of NATO and EU technical standards.
                Significant assistance to Ukraine's defense industry in solving current problems and related problems can be provided by private business through the active implementation of various projects in the defense industry in the framework of public-private partnership (PPP). There are a large number of PPP interpretations and definitions that reflect the multifaceted nature of this process.
                In a broad sense, PPP is an institutional and organizational alliance between the state and business to implement national and international, large-scale and local, but always socially significant projects in a wide range of activities: from the development of strategically important industries and research and development. to provide public services.
            </p>
    
            <p>However, over the last decade, public-private partnerships have become more widespread in this specific area. Attracting private investment, selling or transferring state property to a concession, entrepreneurial initiative are widely used in the production of weapons and military equipment in many countries.
                Analysis of the role of PPPs in the defense industry of leading countries leads to the conclusion that, as a rule, the initiator of cooperation with a private partner is the state.
                Guaranteed considerable funding for military-technical programs makes the sphere of defense-industrial production attractive for private business, and not only for small and medium-sized enterprises. Awareness of the needs of the Defense Ministry in the implementation of military-technical projects, as well as the transition to weapons life cycle contracts, which allows private businesses to see prospects and organize planning for long term. A well-developed legal framework and an efficient judicial system give private business confidence that its rights and interests will be protected.
                For Ukraine, in today's conditions, it is important to involve the private sector in the status of an equal partner of the state to solve military-technical and defense-industrial tasks to provide the Armed Forces and other military formations of Ukraine with weapons, military and special equipment.
                At the same time, the formation of relations on the principles of public-private partnership in the defense sphere is not limited to the state's desire to attract only private sector financial resources to implement weapons and defense programs, but also the need for effective organizational, management and production technologies. PPP provides for cooperation between the state and business for a long period of time, and from the point of view of a private entrepreneur, the risks of investing in capital-intensive defense-industrial programs due to economic instability in the country are very significant.
            </p>
          <p>In previous years, the IX International Scientific and Practical Conference 23 formed distrust of the government and memorable cases of widespread non-implementation of state programs, cancellation of the previous government's decisions, powerlessness before raider seizures, difficulty in obtaining bank loans, difficult business conditions, bureaucracy length of negotiation and conciliation procedures, licensing and permitting system, corruption, etc. The lack of opportunities to obtain financial benefits in the short term is one of the main deterrents for Ukrainian private business.
            In turn, government partners are reticent about private business.
            Numerous examples of the decline of leased and liquidated privatized defense companies (equipment - for scrap metal, territory - for construction of shopping, office and housing centers, workers - on the street). Private business is usually associated with a chain of intermediaries, exorbitant prices for goods and services, counterfeit supplies and defaults, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>Among the next measures to promote the development of PPP in the defense industry of Ukraine, the following are appropriate: - introduction of mechanisms to insure the risks of private investors;
            - optimization of procedures for the implementation of PPP projects aimed at creating new productions of military products; - simplification of the procedure for adoption by state customers of initiative developments of weapons; - improvement of the mechanism of financing public-private partnership projects;
            - introduction of simplified access of private partners to foreign economic activity with dual-use goods; - accelerating the transition from the permit system to the notification system; - improvement of the system of protection of rights to the results of intellectual activity; - the use of royalty payments in the serial production of weapons, developed by a private partner;
            - preferential lending to executors of military-technical projects and state guarantees for bank loans; - reducing the tax burden.
            Thus, the strategic goal of forming and applying public-private partnership mechanisms in the defense industry of Ukraine should be to attract competencies, personnel, innovations, technologies, capital and management experience of private enterprises and organizations to jointly address national security, increase the efficiency of public funds. budget and assets of enterprises, organizations and institutions of the defense industry, joint development and implementation of investment and innovation projects, improving management and information and analytical support in the field of defense, establishing technology transfer and integrated development of military and civilian sectors of Ukrainian industry.</p>
