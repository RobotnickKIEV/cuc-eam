                <h4>Mission, principles of functioning and directions of cluster development</h4>
            <p>The IAC Central Committee is based on the cooperation of a wide range of players from 3 economic sectors (Engineering, Automation, Mechanical Engineering) and from various categories of market participants: small and medium business, large enterprises, universities, research institutions and laboratories, incubators, technology transfer centers, etc.</p>
            <p>The IAM Central Committee supports and develops R&D activities, which in turn depend on the general macroeconomic and fiscal instruments of the Kyiv region and Ukraine. To maximize economic growth, these tools need to be tailored and foster innovation and development. The primary task of the IAM Central Committee is to systematize the current situation and provide proposals for the development of these instruments.</p>

            <p> The mission and tasks of the cluster are determined by the concept of cluster development of IAM, proposed by the Association of "Industrial Automation Enterprises of Ukraine" at the national level. And in line with international best practices. </p>
            <p> 1.1 Changes in approaches to solving strategic development tasks: instead of independent attempts by each individual - the use of collective resources and opportunities </p>
            <p> 1.2 Solving personnel issues: instead of ignoring the problem of brain drain, - mobilization and joint struggle for personnel, growth of the image of engineering professions, creation of personnel policies of modern level, another level of cooperation with free economic zones, etc. </p>
            <p> 1.3 Addressing investment issues: instead of random, unsystematic cheap credit practices, systematically use best tools and practices, including those provided by EU structural funds, national and regional authorities. </p>
            <p> Smart organization - CUC IAM promotes organizational change of local producers and their collective capacity to significantly improve innovation and export potential by </p>
            <p> 2.1 Positioning: IAC Central Committee creates its own positioning on the map of Ukrainian industrial and innovative development, and further - on the map of the EU for maximum use in export purposes. </p>
            <p> 2.2 Joint marketing tools: these tools (marketplaces, shared sites, catalogs, etc.) - are created within the IAM cluster and are related to the joint tools of inter-cluster associations (as in APPAU and Industry 4.0). </p>
            <p> 2.3 Integration into global value chains: cluster members focus on sharing opportunities for better integration into value chains on the global and European stage. </p>
            <p> Cluster development is supported by relevant regional development programs, including the development of the region's infrastructure, services for participants, and other tools and mechanisms that allow us to respond together and better to common challenges. These development programs are planned and implemented by the participants of the IAM Central Committee together with regional executive and local self-government bodies. </p>
            <p> IAC supports and develops R&D activities, which in turn depend on the general macroeconomic and fiscal instruments of the Kyiv region and Ukraine. To maximize economic growth, these tools need to be tailored and foster innovation and development. The primary task of the IAM CEC is to systematize the current situation and provide proposals for the development of these instruments. </p>
            <p> In developing its best practices, the CAM IAM is guided by the standards of the European Cluster Quality Label Program. These practices include monitoring, evaluating and influencing cluster structures on the region's economic development. </p>
            <p> According to the concept of IAM clusters and in accordance with the first constituent assembly of IAM CUC participants in Kyiv, the main directions of cluster development for 2021-22 are the following: </p>
