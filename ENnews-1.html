            <p>The formation of a modern world political system is impossible without the creation of a universal open space of international communication of a qualitatively new level. The general trend in the development of human civilization is to focus on the organization of global systems of productive activities associated with common universal models of communication.
            </p>
      
            <p>In particular, in modern conditions, global threats can be countered only by means for which the system of international relations creates opportunities. The main forms of such counteraction are the creation of global and regional security models with collective means of preventing and overcoming threats.
            </p>
     
            <p>In addition, Russia's aggression has proved the ineffectiveness of existing international institutional structures in ensuring security in the Black Sea region. There are almost no established institutions whose activities are aimed at forming and maintaining regional security and stability. In general, the regional subsystem of international relations is undergoing significant changes and tends to become a confrontational model of the Cold War.
            </p>
    
            <p>It is important to note that in general, Ukraine's regional policy is part of its European integration aspirations, and aims to create effective mechanisms for the state's inclusion in the world political and economic space by creating local schemes of cooperation.
            </p>
          <p>It is obvious that a stable and secure Black Sea region, which is part of the European world, countries with a democratic system, a developed economic system aimed at the well-being of its own population, will greatly enhance both geoeconomic and geopolitical status of Europe.
        </p>
        <p>Undoubtedly, the formation of a reliable security space is a necessary prerequisite for the economic development of the state. Ukraine is interested in forming a common position of the countries of the region on the prospects for the development of security systems as an integral component of a comprehensive system of European security.
        </p>
        <p>In the broader regional context, the formation of the Black Sea system of cooperation based on the deepened partnership of Central European EU member states, as well as the countries participating in the EU's Eastern Partnership program (Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia) is becoming especially important.
        </p>
        <p>Russia's aggressive policy in the region is in many ways contrary to the interests of other Black Sea states and often completely ignores them. This is especially true of Ukraine.
            For our country, the Black Sea region is important in terms of national security and is a platform for cooperation with NATO.
            In addition, access to the Black and Azov Seas is of strategic importance, from an economic and logistical point of view, providing access to the oceans.
            The Black and Azov Seas are the only available trade connections with some countries in the region (Georgia, Turkey) and provide Ukrainian exports to world markets.
            On the other hand, Ukraine is an important partner in the logistics routes of Eastern Europe.
            In addition, access to the sea provides Ukraine with the development of the shipbuilding industry and related technologies, which is an important component of the Ukrainian economy and defense industry.
            The catch of seafood in the Black Sea alone in Ukraine in 2019 amounted to 97.2 thousand tons.
        </p>
        <p>The main reasons for the threat are the intensification of the use of the Black Sea by the aggressor state in the interests of militarization of the region, demonstration of its capabilities to block (prohibit) maritime activities, commercial shipping, establishing control over mining areas inland waters, territorial and maritime waters. ) economic zones of Ukraine.
        </p>
        <p>To solve the existing problem, it is necessary to create an international governing body at the state level and adopt a corresponding European targeted defense program.
            Such steps will ensure coordinated regulation of maritime policy / maritime security and defense / maritime security, as well as a single information platform for national and international governments.
            In addition, it will ensure an effective and timely response to threats to the economic security of the Black Sea region and increase the efficiency of observers and ensure the concentration of information, financial, logistical resources, production and scientific and technical potential.
        </p>
        <p>Solving the problem involves creating conditions to ensure the realization of national interests at the state and international levels by combining the capabilities of domestic production and international technical assistance with comprehensive organizational, legislative and financial support from the state.
        </p>
        <p>The EU Council stressed that the basis of Brussels' approach to regional cooperation in the Black Sea region is respect for international law. It is about respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, including a policy of non-recognition by the EU of the illegal annexation of Crimea, and compliance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, including freedom of navigation.
        </p>
        <p>It is important to remember that in order to work successfully in the international arena, we need a successful presence of the Ukrainian issue at the UN.
        </p>
        <p>To this end, we must work with international and regional organizations at all levels - presidential, governmental and parliamentary.</p>
